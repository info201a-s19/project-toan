## Topic

**Volcanoes**

## Domain of interest
**Why are you interested in this field/domain?**

As a group, we were interested in the various natural phenomenom that occurs around us and decided to delve deeper into an environmental structure that currently has tremendous impact on us in Seattle, Washington, and that would be Mount Rainier. Some of us have taken/are currently taking a volcanos course and we believe this would be another way to learn more about this topic, as it can greatly affect our awareness of volcanic activity.

**What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?**

- Research done by the [NOAA](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/volcano.shtml) (National Centers for Environmental Information) on volcanos show the eruption locations, significance, environmental hazard ratings, and pyroclastic flows.
- Real time data compiled by [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/products/data-and-tools/real-time-data/volcanoes) allows us to see and receive notifications based on hazards. Along with this, you can go back and see previously recorded volcanic activities, the earthquakes associated with it, and the magnitides.
- [Earth Works](https://earthworks.stanford.edu/catalog/harvard-glb-volc) by Stanford Libraries brings us an interactive map of compiled volcano data. This map looks at the point coverage that contains basic geographic and geologic information for worldwide volcanoes that were thought to have been active in the last 10,000 years.

**What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?**

- What type/level of danger does Mount Rainier represent
- What are some trends among volcanos regarding location, frequency, and explosivity
- What might be some indicators of danger for future city development

## Finding data

**Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?**

1. We downloaded from Kaggle, using [this](https://www.kaggle.com/texasdave/volcano-eruptions) dataset by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
2. We downloaded from Smithsonian Institute, using [this](https://volcano.si.edu/).
3. We downloaded from HDX, using [this](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/volcano-population-exposure-index-gvm/resource/e3b1ecf0-ec47-49f7-9011-6bbb7403ef6d).

**How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?**

1. This data was collected from the National Centers for Environmental Information website, [Significant Volcanic Eruption Database](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/servlet/ShowDatasets?dataset=102557&search_look=50&display_look=50). The data was generated via observations and records of past volanic activity from around the world. Depending on your specific classifications/interests (Volcanic Explosivity Index, Country, Region, Lat, Long, Year, Name, etc...) will provide data about volcanos that match those attributes.
2. Scientists in the Department of Mineral Sciences study samples from environments ranging from the mantle to mine drainages, from volcanic arcs to the asteroid belt and compile their findings. 
3. The Humanitarian Data Exchange compiled data from various organisations and groups, built as an open platform for many to merge their findings.
<br>

**How many observations (rows) are in your data?**

1. There are _63_ observations based on the classifications
2. There are _12764_ observations based on the classifications
3. There are _1546_ observations
<br>

**How many features (columns) are in the data?**

1. There are _36_ features based on the classifications
2. There are _26_ features based on the classifications
3. There are _13_ features
<br>

**What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**

1. The datasets can help us further understand the frequency and danger judging from recent and past trends. Using VEI, earthquake and depressurizing correlations from volcanos around the world, making a judgment or providing analysis on, for example, Mount Rainier would be possible.
2. The dataset will allow us to find the trends that exist between locations (long and latitude compared to VEI and strength).
3. Given this dataset, there are features such as "hazard" and "risk" that greatly play into our goal of gauging the danger of Mount Rainier.
